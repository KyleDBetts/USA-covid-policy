### Dataset of Brazilian sub-national Covid-19 government response policies
Drawing on the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) [coding system](https://github.com/OxCGRT/Brazil-covid-policy/blob/master/documentation/codebook_subnational.md), we provide a systematic and objective account of the strength of Covid-19 response policies that have been instigated by Brazil’s federal, state, and state-capital governments. Currently we provide coding up to 31 May 2020 for all indicators of the [stringency index](https://github.com/OxCGRT/Brazil-covid-policy/blob/master/documentation/stringency_index_methodology.md), and for eight of Brazil's state capitals. 


### Survey data on citzens experiences and opinions relating to Covid-19 and government policies
We also present the original [results](https://github.com/OxCGRT/Brazil-covid-policy/blob/master/data/OxCGRT_Brazil_Subnational_31May2020.csv) of a survey of 1,654 citizens across eight state capitals. The survey was designed to ascertain the extent to which reality on the ground in these eight cities meets the World Health Organization’s (WHO) [list of recommendations](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331773/WHO-2019-nCoV-Adjusting_PH_measures-2020.1-eng.pdf)  of the measures that should be put in place before Covid-19 response policies can be safely relaxed.

The survey was conducted over the phone between 6 to 27 May. It uses randomised stratified sampling by age, sex, income and education level.
